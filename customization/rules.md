# Rules

- Vulnboxes and VPN servers are provided by us, you don't have to provide or take care of anything.
- A round lasts 60 seconds, flags are valid for several rounds.
- Flag format: <code> ENO[A-Za-z0-9+\/=]{48}</code>
- Flag submission: <code>nc flags.bambi.ovh 1337</code>
- You will find an [Arkime](https://github.com/arkime/arkime) installation on your vulnbox. Arkime is a traffic analysis tool, not a vulnerable service.

## Scoring

We are currently using the scoring formula by [Faust CTF](https://2019.faustctf.net/information/rules/).

## Social Conduct

The vulnerable services of your opponents are your only valid targets. Do not engage anything else!

Do not attempt to exhaust resources on your opponents' vulnboxes, for example by sending excessive amounts of requests or exploiting vulnerabilities leading to a denial of service.
