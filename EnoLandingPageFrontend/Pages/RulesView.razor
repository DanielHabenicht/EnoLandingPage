<h3>Rules</h3>

<h4>Rule #1: DO NOT ATTACK THE INFRASTRUCTURE</h4>

<p>We are all humans (even students) and we all make mistakes...
    Do not exploit any bug you discovered in the infrastructure.
    Rather report it to the <a href="faq.html#faq">organizers</a>.
    We reserve the right to award exclusive bonus points depending on the bug and its severity.</p>

<h4>Rule #2: NO (D)DOS</h4>
<p>Extensive bandwidth usage and/or attacks leading to the DoS of other teams or the infrastructure will be punished with a permanent ban.
    You will not win using this kind of attacks.</p>

<h4>Rule #3: Prices</h4>
<p>A surprise trophy for the first three places ;)</p>

<h4>Rule #4: The scoring formula</h4>
<p>We are currently using the scoring formula by <a href="https://2019.faustctf.net/information/rules/">Faust CTF</a>.
    Thanks alot for making that public.</p>

<h4>Rule #5: Escape Clause</h4>
<p>We preseve the right to change any rule, mode of competition, or simply anything about this event in any way.</p>

<h4>Rule #6: Flag submission</h4>
<p>The Flagsubmission is done via a tcp connection to host <strong>10.0.13.37</strong> on port <strong>1337</strong>.
    There you can just send the flag or multiple flags delimited by \n characters.
    Each flag will be checked by the backend and then a message is returned picked by this code:</p>
<ul>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.Ok =&gt; "VALID: Flag accepted!",</li>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.Invalid =&gt; "INVALID: You have submitted an invalid string!",</li>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.Duplicate =&gt; "RESUBMIT: You have already sent this flag!",</li>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.Own =&gt; "OWNFLAG: This flag belongs to you!",</li>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.Old =&gt; "OLD: You have submitted an old flag!",</li>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.UnknownError =&gt; "ERROR: An unexpected error occured :(",</li>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.InvalidSenderError =&gt; "ILLEGAL: Your IP address does not belong to any team's subnet!",</li>
    <li>FlagSubmissionResult.SpamError =&gt; "SPAM: You should send 1 flag per line!",</li>
</ul>
